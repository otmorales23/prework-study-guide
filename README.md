# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a very simple study guide for UC Berkeley's Extension Coding Camp Prework lessons. I made it to help keep track of important things I learned throughout the work. I learned a lot about using Git and JavaScript and was refreshed on my knowledge of HTML and CSS.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about the topics learned during the prework (HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript). If you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics and suggest one to study first.
